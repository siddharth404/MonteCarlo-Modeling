# Monte Carlo Valuation

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of financial instruments, such as options, by simulating thousands of possible price paths.

## Features
- Simulates asset price paths using Monte Carlo methods
- Supports various stochastic models (e.g., Geometric Brownian Motion)
- Calculates option pricing and risk metrics
- Visualizes results with plots and statistical analysis

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the application using the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
